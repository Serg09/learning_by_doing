1) Create homework story in storytracker

2) Create file string_practice.rb

3) Add code

4) Run ```guard```. Got offence of of grouped expression in last line ```puts (string [20...29] * 3).chop.concat(33)```

I also wrote this line:

```puts string [20...29] * 2 + string [20...28].concat(33)```

or

```puts string [20...29] * 2 + string [20...28] + '!'```

or

```puts string ['practice '] * 2 + string ['practice'] + '!'```

which are have no offenses, but I think the one I used with grouped expressions is better. 
 
5) Run homework_tester. Got misspell error. Fixed it.
