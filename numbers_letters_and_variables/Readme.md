Hello World!
---
First I would create a topic branch for this homework

Would open it in Ruby Mine and add file hello_world.rb

Then I would add:

```#!/usr/bin/env ruby```
   
```puts 'Hello World'```

into the file.

Also would run ```guard``` command to test for mistakes.

After passing rubocop test with no offenses would test the code.

In homework_tester directory I would run cucumber gem command and if necessary would correct the errors.

If tests are passes would add, commit and push to a topic branch and do PR.
