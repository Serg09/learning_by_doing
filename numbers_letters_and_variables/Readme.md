1. Create homework story in storytracker

2. Create file number_of seconds.rb

3. Add code

4. Run ```guard`` and got 5 offenses. 4 offenses is long line of code and one is double quotes.
Have experement with split the lines into 2 or 3 lines and change some double quotes to single quotes and still in the output get 1 long line offense,
 and changing the output of last line into two line is not matching the assignment. 
 So I have use long line and double quotes as it is not a issue for RubyMine.
 
5. Run home tester. Got few errors. Had to add few commas.
